            "2008: The report highlights instances where facilities demonstrated uncooperative behavior. For example, during a visit to a penitentiary hospital, prohibited items were found in a detainee’s possession, and staff claimed these items were intended for \"point use,\" while also subjecting the detainee and others to disciplinary measures. This suggests an attempt to conceal misconduct rather than engage transparently with oversight bodies.\n",

            "Additionally, the report references legal safeguards for the **independent prevention mechanism (NPM)**, noting that according to the **Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT)**, the NPM should have unrestricted access to detention facilities and the ability to conduct private interviews. The report also underscores that individuals have the right to **effective legal remedies** under **Article 2(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)** when their rights are violated, which aligns with the NPM’s mandate to ensure accountability and protection against ill-treatment.\n",
            "2009: The report highlights instances where **police and investigative bodies failed to cooperate effectively** in addressing human rights violations. For example, despite instructions from the Police Chief and Deputy Prosecutor General to comply with legal deadlines and safeguards for detainees, improper practices persisted, indicating a lack of meaningful follow-through. Additionally, the **Special Investigative Service (SIS) dismissed allegations of police misconduct**—such as torture and beatings—without thorough investigation, often relying solely on police statements and pressuring victims to withdraw complaints. This suggests systemic resistance to accountability.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regarding **legal safeguards**, the report references specific provisions, such as:\n",
            "- **Article 137(2) of the RoA Criminal Procedure Code**, which limits detention in arrest custody centers to **three days** unless transport issues prevent transfer.\n",
            "- The **RoA Law on Custody of Arrested and Detained Persons**, which outlines protections for detainees’ rights.\n",

            "While the report does not explicitly use the term **\"NPM\" (National Preventive Mechanism)**, it describes oversight roles akin to an NPM’s functions—such as **monitoring detention conditions, documenting violations, and advocating for reforms**—through the actions of the **Human Rights Defender (Ombudsman)**. The Defender’s visits to police stations, penitentiaries, and military units, along with recommendations to authorities, reflect efforts to uphold legal safeguards and improve compliance. However, the persistent violations underscore **gaps in enforcement and cooperation** by the visited facilities.\n",

            "Regarding legal safeguards, the report references specific legal time limits for detaining individuals in police departments and detention facilities, such as the three-hour limit for holding apprehended or invited individuals in police departments and the 72-hour limit for detention facilities. Violations of these timeframes are noted as issues. However, the report does not explicitly outline legal safeguards specifically protecting the **National Preventive Mechanism (NPM)** itself.\n",
